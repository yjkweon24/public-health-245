NAME: Fitting Percentage of Body Fat to Simple Body Measurements

SIZE: 252 observations, 19 variables

DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
Percentage of body fat, age, weight, height, and ten body circumference measurements (e.g., abdomen) are recorded for 252 men.  Body fat, a measure of health, is estimated through an underwater weighing technique.  Fitting body fat to the other measurements using multiple regression provides a convenient way of estimating body fat for men using only a scale and a measuring tape.
